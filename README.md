This project demonstrates how to scrape and analyze Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic "I Have a Dream" speech using Python. It utilizes:

- **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup** for web scraping
- **NLTK** for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization
- **Regular Expressions (re)** for text cleaning

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Web Scraping**: Fetches the speech text from a specified URL.
2. **Text Extraction**: Parses the HTML content to extract relevant text.
3. **Text Cleaning**: Removes unwanted characters and punctuation using regular expressions.
4. **Tokenization**: Splits the text into individual words.
5. **Stopword Removal**: Eliminates common English stopwords that do not contribute to the analysis.
6. **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base or dictionary form.
7. **Frequency Analysis**: Counts the frequency of each lemmatized word.
